            <p>Police in Uganda are investigating a father and daughter for allegedly giving people a fake vaccine against the coronavirus.

                There is currently no inoculation against the disease, which has killed more than 3,800 people around the world.
                
                There are currently 18 confirmed cases of coronavirus in sub-Saharan Africa but none in Uganda.
                
                Police say they started receiving information on Friday that people in the district of Mayuge, 120 km (74 miles) east of the capital, Kampala, were being given a concoction to supposedly inoculate them against the coronavirus.
                
                They then arrested two people – believed to be behind the scam. Both have since been released on police bond pending further investigation.
                
                Samples of the liquid they allegedly gave victims orally have been taken to the government forensic laboratory in Kampala for testing.
                
                It is not known how many people could have taken the concoction.
                
                A police spokesperson told the BBC they believed the suspects gave the fake vaccine to victims for free with hopes of later charging for it once demand had been created.</p>

            <p>South Korea has been hit hard from travel restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.

                Its national carrier has cut more than 80% of its international capacity while encouraging employees to take voluntary leave.
                
                In the memo, Woo Kee-hong, Korean Air's president said the airline couldn't predict how long the crisis would last.
                
                "But if the situation continues for a longer period, we may reach the threshold where we cannot guarantee the company's survival," he said in the memo, which was seen by Reuters.
                
                A spokesman for Korean Air told the BBC the purpose of the internal memo was "to encourage employees and ask for understanding to overcome the crisis together".
                
                "We have gone through numerous difficulties for the past 51 years, and I'm confident that we will overcome this crisis together," he said.</p>

            <p>Not long after I moved to Kelowna, a city in southern British Columbia known for its wineries, water sports and hiking trails, I saw a news story about a monster sighting. Two brothers had seen something undulating across the water in the middle of Okanagan Lake, an 84-mile long lake that curves down the Okanagan Valley past Kelowna in the shape of a serpent. The wave crested and fanned out like a wake, but there wasn’t a boat in sight. They were adamant it was Ogopogo.</p>

            <p>Speaking after the Italian government imposed travel restrictions across the country, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said Austrians returning from Italy would have to self-isolate for two weeks.

                Austria has seen 158 cases of coronavirus so far.
                
                Mr Kurz said the number was still very low but the disease was deadly.
                
                Austria and Italy share a border north of Italy's South Tyrol region. On Tuesday, South Tyrol, in common with the rest of Italy, closed all cultural centres and restricted access to bars and cafes to daytime hours.
                
                Italy's nationwide lockdown limits travel to those with "proven work requirements or situations of necessity". All sporting events have been suspended, and schools and universities have been shut until 3 April. Employees have been urged either to work from home or take annual leave.</p>

            <p>His visit comes as China recorded its lowest number of infections, just 19 on Tuesday, all in Wuhan apart from two who had arrived from overseas.

                China has seen 80,754 confirmed cases, 3,136 of whom have died.
                
                The visit was Mr Xi's first trip to the city since the outbreak began.
                
                According to state media, Mr Xi arrived in Wuhan on Tuesday to inspect epidemic prevention and control work in the province.
                
                Wuhan and its province, Hubei, have been locked down in order to prevent the spread of the disease. The president visited a community in the city currently in self-quarantine.
                
                During his visit, Mr Xi declared that the spread of the disease had been "basically curbed" in Hubei province and Wuhan.
                
                "Initial success has been made in stabilising the situation and turning the tide in Hubei and Wuhan," he said.

            <p>The change will take effect from Tuesday, with fans now banned from the game between Eibar and Real Sociedad.

                La Liga acted on guidance from Spain's ministry of health and the country's sports council.
                
                Barcelona's Champions League match against Napoli on 18 March will also be played at an empty Nou Camp.
                
                "The decision has been made strictly for health reasons," said Joan Guix, Catalunya government's health chief.
                
                It is the second Spanish-Italian Champions League fixture at which supporters have been banned, following Valencia versus Atalanta on Tuesday.
                
                Sevilla's match against Roma and Getafe's game with Inter Milan in the Europa League have suffered the same fate.</p>

            <p>The 18-year-old has previously said she wears baggy clothes to avoid being sexualised, and addressed criticism of that choice during a video interlude.

                "If what I wear is comfortable, I am not a woman," she said. "If I shed the layers, I am a slut".
                
                "Though you've never seen my body, you still judge me for it. Why?" she asked.</p>

            <p>The first is his approval ratings. Nothing unusual in that. Ever since the end of World War Two and Gallup introducing its regular polling on this, every president from Harry Truman onwards has kept a wary eye on how they are being seen by the great American public - that is normal.

                The second figure is the stock market. While other presidents have seen that as a barometer to keep a watch on, no-one has obsessed about Wall Street like Donald Trump. Or if they have, they haven't provided a running commentary in quite the same way that he has.

            <p>His calculation is that if the stock market is soaring, then his approval ratings will go up and QED - he will be re-elected in November this year. So even when the stock market has the wind in its sails, the president will inhale deeply and blow forcefully in the hope of pushing the Dow Jones industrial average even higher. And every time the Dow or the S&P 500 hits a new high, he tweets to celebrate it - 280 times to be exact. In other words, roughly once every four days of his presidency he has exalted the markets.</p>

            <p>President Trump is used to fighting from his bunker when a crisis arrives - and let's face it, the past three and a bit years haven't lacked drama. But the coronavirus is quantitatively and qualitatively different from anything he has faced. With the Robert Mueller investigation (remember that?), there were names. People: lyin' Jim Comey, Bob Mueller, little Jeff Sessions, Michael Cohen, Andrew McCabe etc. And during the impeachment trial there was a whole host of people that Donald Trump could swing a haymaking left hook at: shifty Schiff, nervous Nancy, cryin' Chuck Schumer. As Donald Trump will tell you, he's a great counter-puncher.</p>
